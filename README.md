# Howl's Moving Castle: another door

This is the Team7 level design project for the game "Howl's Moving Castle: another door"

## High Concepts

After the previous adventure Howl, Sophie, Calcifer, Markl and the witch of the wasted lands live a happy time. Their idyll is interrupted by Suliman informing Howl of the oncoming, from the overseas, of some monstrous animals covered with a strange green mud and ruled as marionettes by spirits similar to those evoked by Howl in moments of despair. The protagonist understands that he is personally involved in the spread of this new evil: years before Howl clashed with the wizard Layton, and committed the error of imprisoning him with his own spirits of despair. Layton learned how to control them during his imprisonment and, once freed by some magic students, dominates the sentient minds by amplifying their own negative feelings, looking for revenge. Without confessing it to Suliman, Howl leaves for the other continent hoping to defeat his opponent while keeping the consequences of his impulsiveness hidden, but this time Layton gets the better on him. Sophie and her friends, alarmed by the magician’s disappearance, try to follow his tracks beyond the door that he created to reach the other continent, but they soon find themselves fleeing Layton’s henchmen, who follow them back in the moving castle leading to its destruction. They must therefore ask Suliman for help, who prepares them for the adventure and orders Heen, in the form of a warrior, to watch over them. Over the ocean, with the help of the King Beuron ousted by Layton, they retrace the journey of Howl, who now wanders coursed through Cal as an unrecognizable child without memory (following Ben, the most trusted soldier of Beuron). The team must find Howl and restore his physical form to bring him back to battle, while Layton rallies his forces to attack their kingdom and defeat Suliman too, completing his revenge. Gathering together after growing up in difficulties, Sophie and Howl manage to defeat Layton.

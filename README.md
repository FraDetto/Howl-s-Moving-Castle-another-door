# Howl's Moving Castle: another door

This is the Team7 level design project for the game "Howl's Moving Castle: another door"

## High Concepts

After the previous adventure Howl, Sophie, Calcifer, Markl and the Witch of the Waste live a happy time. Their idyll is interrupted by Suliman informing Howl of the oncoming, from the overseas, of some monstrous animals covered with a strange green mud and ruled as marionettes by spirits similar to those evoked by Howl in moments of despair. The protagonist understands that he is personally involved in the spread of this new evil: years before Howl clashed with his old classmate Layton, and did the mistake of imprisoning him with the spirits of despair that he accidentally evoked. During his imprisonment Layton learned how to control them and, once freed by chance, dominates the sentient minds by amplifying their own negative feelings, looking for revenge. Without confessing his involvement to Suliman, Howl leaves for the other continent but this time Layton gets the better on him. Sophie and her friends, alarmed by the magician’s disappearance, try to follow his tracks beyond the door that he created to reach the other continent, but they soon find themselves fleeing Layton’s henchmen, who follow them back in the moving castle leading to its destruction. They must therefore ask Suliman for help, who prepares them for the adventure and orders Heen, in the form of a warrior, to watch over them. Over the ocean, they soon found out that the mud it’s everywhere but that can be removed after some hours in the hot water. With the help of the King Beuron ousted by Layton, they retrace the journey of Howl, who now wanders coursed through Cal as an unrecognizable child without memory (following Ben, the most trusted soldier of Beuron). The team comes to believe that Howl is dead, but finally they find him and restore his physical form bringing him back to battle, while Layton rallies his forces to attack their kingdom and defeat Suliman too, completing his revenge. They have the possibility to rid Cal of Layton’s monsters, collaborating with the resistance during the game. Gathering together after growing up in difficulties, Sophie and Howl manage to defeat Layton back to Kingsbury.

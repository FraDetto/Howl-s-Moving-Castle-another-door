# Howl's Moving Castle: another door

This is the Team7 level design project for the game "Howl's Moving Castle: another door"

## High Concepts

After the previous adventure Howl, Sophie, Calcifer, Markl and the witch of the wasted lands live a happy time. Their idyll is interrupted by Suliman informing Howl of the oncoming, from the overseas, of some monstrous animals covered with a strange green mud and ruled as marionettes by spirits similar to those evoked by Howl in moments of despair. The protagonist understands that he is personally involved in the spread of this new evil: years before his classmate Layton, jealous of Howl's powers and his influence on Suliman, tried to steal Calcifer pretending to be a charming girl. Howl was so deeply infatuated with the image created by the magician that he released umpteen demons of despair once the deception was revealed. Defeated Layton, he secretly exiled him in a small magical urn, filling it for further punishment with the powerful evoked spirits. During this imprisonment, however, Layton has learned how to control the spirits and, once freed, dominates the sentient minds by amplifying their own negative feelings. Without confessing it to Suliman, Howl leaves for the other continent hoping to defeat his opponent while keeping the consequences of his impulsiveness hidden, but this time it will be the wizard Layton to prevail. Sophie and her friends must therefore ask Suliman for help, alarmed by the magician's disappearance and fleeing Layton's henchmen, who also lead to the destruction of the castle. Suliman prepares them for the adventure and orders Heen, in the form of a warrior, to watch over them. Over the ocean, with the help of the King Breunor ousted by Layton, they retrace the journey of Howl, who now wanders as a child without memory. The team must find Howl and his old age to bring him back to battle, while Layton rallies his forces to attack their kingdom and defeat Suliman too, completing his revenge. Gathering together after growing up in difficulties, Sophie and Howl manage to defeat Layton.
